Important! Before play the Game you need to import DOTween:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676



Please read "EXPLANATORY_DOC" in Docs folder before and with notes below.

Key notes:
0. Reception, Elevator, Utility are mandatory for every Hotel. In a single instance each.
1. Every Hotel consists of Areas.

2. Area numbers should start with number one(1).
3. Area number one(1) is enabled by default. Areas number two(2), three(3), four(4) etc. needs to be purchased while play.

4. Room numbers should start with number zero(0).
5. Room number zero(0) is enabled by default. Rooms number two(2), three(3), four(4) etc. needs to be purchased while play.

6. After Customer(Unit) left Room, system will check if there is available ToiletCabine. If YES - Customer will go there. If NOT - leave the Hotel.
7. System will check only for ToiletCabine with the same Area number that has Room, Customer was in.

8. Cleaner cleans only Rooms with which they has the same Area number.

9. Every Hotel has Level. Level by default is one(1).
10. Every Hotel has Progress value and MaxProgress. Progress by default is zero(0).
11. MaxProgress value for each Level are getting from Rooms and Toilets parameter "PurchaseProgressReward" and "UpdateProgressReward", that belong to Area with Lvl parameter equal to Level.

12. By purchasing(upgrading) Room or Toilet, paremeter "PurchaseProgressReward" or "UpdateProgressReward" values will be added to the Progress.
13. Once Progress equal or more then MaxProgress, Level encreased by 1.
14. When Level changed, Area which can be purchased at that Level is becoming available to purchase.

15. For Room number zero(0), parameter "PurchaseProgressReward" must be zero(0).
Since this Room is available by default and this value can never be added to the Progress value.

16. Elevator will swith to "ElevatorNoHotelSceneState" state if there is no next Hotel in Build Settins.
For example: your current Hotel is one(scene index = 1 in Build Settings) and you dont have scene with index = 2.

17. Loader delivers ToiletPaper to the Toilet whatever Area Toilet is.

18. To increase/decrease transaction speed modify _amountDefault parameter in the ItemController script.
